# JiraIssueLinkVisualiser

A Chrome extension that will add an issue link visualisation on the right hand pane when in Atlassian Jira. Requires the REST API to be enabled in JIRA to work!

# Why I build this?
 One day whilst working on an issue I had trouble keeping track of the status of related issues and sub issues without scrolling. This is my attempt at making a visual aid for issue links.


## Built with
* [Jquery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
* [VivaGraphJS](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/)


## Todo:
* Add dependency management system (instead of hardcoding)
* Sprint
* Epic or Epic Link
* Age of issue?
* Issue activity (Number of comments?)
